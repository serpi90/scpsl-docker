A [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image to run a dedicated server for [SCP: Secret Lab](https://store.steampowered.com/app/700330/SCP_Secret_Laboratory/).

## Usage

An example sequence could be:

```bash
docker build -t scpsl https://github.com/FragSoc/scpsl-docker.git && \
    docker run -d -p 7777:7777/udp -v $PWD/scpsl_config:/config scpsl
```

The image exposes one volume at `/config` for the server's configuration files.

The image exposes one port, defaulting to `7777/udp` (see below).

### Environment Variables

Argument Key | Default Value | Description
-------------|---------------|-----------
`UID`        |         `999` | Desired user ID of the user the server will run as. You might want to override this for easier directory permission management.
`GID`        |         `999` | Twin to `UID`, setting the primary group id of the user.
`PORT`       |        `7777` | Port that the game will be run under. **WARNING:** you must still set this in `/config/config_gamplay.txt`
`STEAM_BETA` |               | A beta string to pass to `steamcmd`. For example: `-beta mybetaname -betapassword letmein`.
